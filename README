PLATFORMS

ext-blog do not use any compiler specific APIs, so it can run in most Common
Lisp compilers in theory. But it still need to test. Currently ext-blog has
been tested on those compilers:

* SBCL
* Clozure CL

There compilers are not supported now:

* ABCL
* Allegro CL
* CLISP, I have tried this compiler, but failed with hunchentoot:start which
 hangs the interpreter. After some google, I suppose it's because of CLISP 
 thread support.
* CMUCL, some dependent libraries can not be compiled, i.e, parenscript
* ECL
* LispWorks
* Scieneer CL

INSTALL

I will use SBCL to illustrate how to install ext-blog. ext-blog depends on some
third-party lisp libraries, so I suggest you to use quicklisp to install these 
libraries. 

When you download ext-blog full source codes, go to ext-blog root directory, 
and run SBCL, i.e:

    cd ext-blog
    SBCL

And if you're the first time to load ext-blog, you can load dep.lisp to intall
these third-party libraries by quicklisp first, i.e:

    (load "dep.lisp")

And if you already have installed quicklisp, it will download some libraries 
first.

After that, everything is ready. You can load ext-blog by asdf, i.e:

    (asdf:load-system :ext-blog)

After that, you can run ext-blog now, i.e:

    (ext-blog:start)

ext-blog will launch a web server using hunchentoot at port 8080. So you can 
visit it to test:

    http://localhost:8080

If you're the first time to run ext-blog, there's no data files for your blog,
so you will be indirected to initializing page to setup your blog. The setup 
page only needs admin user name and password.

After that, everytime you want to launch ext-blog, you can only load it in SBCL
 and start it, i.e:

    (asdf:load-system :ext-blog)
    (ext-blog:start)
